# LUSID<sup>®</sup> Python SDK

The LUSID API can be accessed from Python using this SDK which can be installed using `pip`:

```
$ pip install lusid-sdk
```

A pre-generated version of the latest SDK is included in the `lusid-sdk-python` folder based on the OpenAPI specification named `lusid.json` in the root folder.  The most up to date version of the OpenAPI specification can be downloaded from https://api.lusid.com/swagger/v0/swagger.json

In addition to the SDK, a set of examples on how to use the SDK can be found in the [tests](https://github.com/finbourne/lusid-sdk-python/tree/master/lusid-sdk-python) folder.  These exist in the form of unit tests.  Further instructions on running them can be found in the [README](https://github.com/finbourne/lusid-sdk-python/blob/master/lusid-sdk-python/readme.md).

# Generating the SDK

If you would prefer to generate the Python SDK locally from the FINBOURNE OpenAPI specification, this can be  done using [autorest](https://github.com/Azure/autorest) and `docker`:

```
$ docker-compose up && docker-compose rm -f
```

If `docker` is not available then the SDK can be generated using `autorest` natively using the following command, ensuring this `README.md` is in the same folder as the command is run from:

```
$ autorest --python --use=@microsoft.azure/autorest.modeler@2.3.40
```

For other options on installation see [Installing AutoRest](https://aka.ms/autorest/install) on the AutoRest github page.

> see https://aka.ms/autorest

The resulting SDK will be generated in the `lusid-sdk-python` folder.

# Client Runtimes

Further details for the Python implementation for `autorest` can be found below:

## Configuration 
The following are the settings used by Autorest to generate the SDK and must only be edited if you are familar with the `autorest` configuration options.

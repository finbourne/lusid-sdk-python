        Now that we have built our list of holding adjustments we want to update the portfolio with them.

        Note that when we do this we need to specify an effective date for the holdings. This date is the date from 
        which the holdings are valid. In this case the date will be the official date of the transition of the funds to 
        us. 

        Note that our portfolio also has an effective date from which it is active. This was created automatically when
        we created our portfolio. The effecitve date of our holdings must be after the effective date of the portfolio. 

        The reason for this is that LUSID is built upon a bi-temporal data store. The implications of this are that 
        every object has two dates attached to it. These are the effectiveAt date and the asAt date. 

        The asAt date defines the date at which an object was added to the system. For example in the portfolio we 
        just created the asAt date is today.

        The effectiveAt date defines the date from which an object should be valid. For example if we set our 
        portfolio's effective date to be the 1st of January 2018, it will be valid from that date and we can add
        any transactions to it from that date onwards. We cannot add holdings or transactions to this portfolio before 
        this date as the portfolio did not exist and as such there is nothing for the holdings to be attached to. 

        This bi-temporal store gives us the ability to look re-create how our system looks at any point in time. For
        example if we look at the state of our system using an asAt date of 2 days before today and thus 2 days before
        our portfolio was created, we will not be able to find our portfolio as it had not been created in the system at
        that point in time.

        We can add transactions individually or in batches using a list of TransactionRequest objects. More information
        can be found about the format of TransactionRequests can be found in the LUSID docs
        https://docs.lusid.com/#operation/UpsertTransactions

        Each TransactionRequest object has the following properties:

            - transaction_id: A transaction identifier unique to a scope
            - type: The transaction type, by default the following are already available 
                - 'Buy'
                - 'Sell'
                - 'StockIn'
                - 'StockOut'
                - 'CoverShort'
                - 'SellShort'
                - 'FxBuy'
                - 'FxSell'
                - 'FwdFxBuy'
                - 'FwdFxSell'
                - 'FundsIn'
                - 'FundsOut'
                - 'OLFC' (Open Long Futures Contract)
                - 'CLFC' (Close Long Futures Contract)
                - 'OSFC' (Open Short Futures contract)
                - 'CSFC' (Close Short Futures Contract)
            - instrument_uid: The Lusid Instrument Id also known as LUID
            - transaction_date: The date of the transaction as an ISO8601 datetime, that is "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ"
            - settlement_date: The date of the settlement as an ISO8601 datetime, that is "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ"
            - units: The quantity of units of the instrument involved in the transaction
            - transactionPrice: A TransactionPrice object with a price and type
                - price: The price of the transaction
                - type: The type of the price, available options are 'Price', 'Yield' or 'Spread'
            - totalConsideration: The total value of the transaction in settlement currency as a CurrencyAndAmount object
                - amount: The amount of the currency
                - currency: The currency e.g. 'GBP' as an ISO4217 currency code
            - exchangeRate: Rate between transaction and settlement currency
            - transactionCurrency: The currency of the transaction
            - source: Where this transaction came from options are 'System' and 'Client'

        To optimise performance we have made 5 trades so far that we need to add. Once again in reality these trades
        would be fed through from the order management or execution management system.

        1) We sold 410,000 WPP shares on the back of the effects of GDPR on the advertising industry
        2) We bought 70,000 ULVR (Unilever) shares on the prediction of a quantitative model
        3) We sold all our KGF (Kingfisher) shares on the back of a strong analysts pessimistic forecast for home improvement
        4) We bought 180,000 shares in ABF (Associated Bristish Foods) to get more exposure to retail after the sale of the Kingfisher shares
        5) We bought 669,180 shares in GLEN (Glencore) based on fundamental analysis revealing it to be under priced off the back of recent negative news about the company

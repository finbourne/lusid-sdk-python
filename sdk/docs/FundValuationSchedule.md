# FundValuationSchedule

Specification object for the valuation schedule, how do we determine which days we wish to perform a valuation upon.
## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**effective_from** | **str** | If present, the EffectiveFrom and EffectiveAt dates are interpreted as a range of dates for which to perform a valuation.  In this case, valuation is calculated for the portfolio(s) for each business day in the given range. | [optional] 
**effective_at** | **str** | The market data time, i.e. the time to run the valuation request effective of. | [optional] 
**diary_entry** | **str** | The diary entry to use for the valuation schedule. This is used to determine the date on which the valuation should be performed. | [optional] 
**tenor** | **str** | Tenor, e.g \&quot;1D\&quot;, \&quot;1M\&quot; to be used in generating the date schedule when effectiveFrom and effectiveAt are both given and are not the same. | [optional] 
**roll_convention** | **str** | When Tenor is given and is \&quot;1M\&quot; or longer, this specifies the rule which should be used to generate the date schedule.  For example, \&quot;EndOfMonth\&quot; to generate end of month dates, or \&quot;1\&quot; to specify the first day of the applicable month. | [optional] 
**holiday_calendars** | **List[str]** | The holiday calendar(s) that should be used in determining the date schedule.  Holiday calendar(s) are supplied by their names, for example, \&quot;CoppClark\&quot;.  Note that when the calendars are not available (e.g. when the user has insufficient permissions),  a recipe setting will be used to determine whether the whole batch should then fail or whether the calendar not being available should simply be ignored. | [optional] 
**valuation_date_times** | **List[str]** | If given, this is the exact set of dates on which to perform a valuation. This will replace/override all other specified values if given. | [optional] 
**business_day_convention** | **str** | When Tenor is given and is not equal to \&quot;1D\&quot;, there may be cases where \&quot;date + tenor\&quot; land on non-business days around month end.  In that case, the BusinessDayConvention, e.g. modified following \&quot;MF\&quot; would be applied to determine the next GBD. | [optional]

# ReconciliationRule

Base class for representing reconciliation rules in LUSID. Reconciliation rules describe how a comparison between two items in the reconciliation should be performed and what constitutes equality. This does not influence WHAT constitutes a match, but only whether once a line has been matched whether an item within it matches another item. If a rule is not given for an item, it will default to equality comparison. This base class should not be directly instantiated; each supported ReconciliationRuleType has a corresponding inherited class.
## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**rule_type** | **str** | The available values are: ReconcileNumericRule, ReconcileDateTimeRule, ReconcileStringRule, ReconcileExact | 
## Example

```python
from lusid.models.reconciliation_rule import ReconciliationRule
from typing import Any, Dict, Union
from pydantic.v1 import BaseModel, Field, StrictStr, validator

rule_type: StrictStr = "example_rule_type"
reconciliation_rule_instance = ReconciliationRule(rule_type=rule_type)

```

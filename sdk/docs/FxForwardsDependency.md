# FxForwardsDependency

Indicates a dependency on an FxForwardCurve.  Identical to Fx dependencies in the meaning of domestic and foreign currencies, but describes a *set* of fx rates.  These rates are quoted rates for fx forwards, which can be used to interpolate the forward rate at a specific time in the future.  In the case of pips, the absolute rates can be expressed as rate = spotFx + pips / pipsPerUnit

# FxForwardsDependency

Indicates a dependency on an FxForwardCurve.  Identical to Fx dependencies in the meaning of domestic and foreign currencies, but describes a *set* of fx rates.  These rates are quoted rates for fx forwards, which can be used to interpolate the forward rate at a specific time in the future.  In the case of pips, the absolute rates can be expressed as rate = spotFx + pips / pipsPerUnit

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**domestic_currency** | **str** | DomesticCurrency is the first currency in a currency pair quote e.g. eur-gbp, eur is the domestic currency. | 
**foreign_currency** | **str** | ForeignCurrency is the second currency in a currency pair quote e.g. eur-gbp, gbp is the foreign currency. | 
**curve_type** | **str** | Used to describe the format in which the curve is expressed  e.g. FxFwdCurve (general term to describe any representation), TenorFxFwdCurve, PipsFxFwdCurve. | 
**var_date** | **datetime** | The effectiveDate of the entity that this is a dependency for.  Unless there is an obvious date this should be, like for a historic reset, then this is the valuation date. | 
**dependency_type** | **str** | The available values are: Opaque, Cash, Discounting, EquityCurve, EquityVol, Fx, FxForwards, FxVol, IndexProjection, IrVol, Quote, Vendor | 

## Example

```python
from lusid.models.fx_forwards_dependency import FxForwardsDependency

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of FxForwardsDependency from a JSON string
fx_forwards_dependency_instance = FxForwardsDependency.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print FxForwardsDependency.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
fx_forwards_dependency_dict = fx_forwards_dependency_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of FxForwardsDependency from a dict
fx_forwards_dependency_form_dict = fx_forwards_dependency.from_dict(fx_forwards_dependency_dict)

# CreditRating

Object describing a credit rating,  which assesses the stability and credit worthiness of a legal entity  and hence its likelihood of defaulting on its outstanding obligations (typically debt).
## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**rating_source** | **str** | The provider of the credit rating, which will typically be an agency such as Moody&#39;s or Standard and Poor. | 
**rating** | **str** | The credit rating provided by the rating source. This would expected to be consistent with the rating scheme of that agency/source. | 
## Example

```python
from lusid.models.credit_rating import CreditRating
from typing import List, Dict, Optional, Any, Union, TYPE_CHECKING
from typing_extensions import Annotated
from pydantic.v1 import BaseModel, StrictStr, StrictInt, StrictBool, StrictFloat, StrictBytes, Field, validator, ValidationError, conlist, constr

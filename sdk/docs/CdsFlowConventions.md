## Example

```python
from lusid.models.cds_flow_conventions import CdsFlowConventions

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of CdsFlowConventions from a JSON string
cds_flow_conventions_instance = CdsFlowConventions.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print CdsFlowConventions.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
cds_flow_conventions_dict = cds_flow_conventions_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of CdsFlowConventions from a dict
cds_flow_conventions_form_dict = cds_flow_conventions.from_dict(cds_flow_conventions_dict)

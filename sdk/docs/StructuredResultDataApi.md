# **create_data_map**
> UpsertStructuredDataResponse create_data_map(scope, request_body)

CreateDataMap: Create data map

Create or update one or more structured result store address definition data maps in a particular scope. Note these are immutable and cannot be changed once created.                In the request, each data map must be keyed by a unique correlation ID. This ID is ephemeral and not stored by LUSID.  It serves only to easily identify each data map object in the response.                The response returns both the collection of successfully created or updated data maps, as well as those that failed.  For each failure, a reason is provided.                It is important to check the failed set for any unsuccessful results.

[EXPERIMENTAL] DeleteStructuredResultData: Delete structured result data

Delete one or more structured result data items from a particular scope. Each item is identified by a unique ID which includes  information about its type as well as the exact effective datetime (to the microsecond) at which it entered the system (became valid).

# **get_data_map**
> GetDataMapResponse get_data_map(scope, request_body)

[EXPERIMENTAL] GetDataMap: Get data map

Retrieve one or more structured result store address definition data maps from a particular scope.                Each data map can be identified by its invariant key, which can be thought of as a permanent URL.  For each ID, LUSID returns the most recently matched item.                In the request, each data map must be keyed by a unique correlation ID. This ID is ephemeral and not stored by LUSID.  It serves only to easily identify each data map in the response.                The response returns three collections. The first contains successfully retrieved data maps. The second contains those with a  valid identifier but that could not be found. The third contains those that failed because LUSID could not construct a valid identifier from the request.                For the IDs that failed to resolve or could not be found, a reason is provided.                It is important to check the failed sets for any unsuccessful results.

# **get_structured_result_data**
> GetStructuredResultDataResponse get_structured_result_data(scope, request_body, as_at=as_at, max_age=max_age)

GetStructuredResultData: Get structured result data

Retrieve one or more structured result data items from a particular scope.                Each item can be identified by its time invariant structured result data identifier. For each ID, LUSID  returns the most recently matched item with respect to the provided (or default) effective datetime.                 An optional maximum age range window can be specified to control how far back to look from the specified  effective datetime. LUSID returns the most recent item within this window.                In the request, each data item must be keyed by a unique correlation ID. This ID is ephemeral and not stored by LUSID.  It serves only to easily identify each data item in the response.    The response returns three collections. The first contains successfully retrieved data items. The second contains those with a  valid identifier but that could not be found. The third contains those that failed because LUSID could not construct a valid identifier from the request.

[EXPERIMENTAL] GetVirtualDocument: Get Virtual Documents

Retrieve one or more virtual documents from a particular scope.                Each item can be identified by its time invariant structured result data identifier.

### Parameters

Name | Type | Description  | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
 **scope** | **str**| The scope in which to construct the virtual documents. |

# **get_virtual_document_rows**
> PagedResourceListOfVirtualRow get_virtual_document_rows(scope, code, source, result_type, effective_at, as_at=as_at, page=page, limit=limit, filter=filter)

[EARLY ACCESS] GetVirtualDocumentRows: Get Virtual Document Rows

Retrieve the rows of the virtual document with the specified identifiers and the given effectiveAt date time.    Get virtual document rows merges multiple StructuredResultData items upserted with UpsertStructuredResultData  for a single StructuredResultDataId.                Since an item of StructuredResultData is always upserted with a StructuredResultDataId, of which  effectiveAt is a part, then merging across the asAt dimension is supported but not merging across the  effectiveAt dimension.

# **upsert_result_value**
> UpsertStructuredDataResponse upsert_result_value(scope, request_body)

[EXPERIMENTAL] UpsertResultValue: Upsert result value

Create or update one or more Upsert one or more result values in a particular scope. An item is updated if it already exists  and created if it does not.                In the request, each data item must be keyed by a unique correlation ID. This ID is ephemeral and not stored by LUSID.  It serves only to easily identify each data item in the response.                The response returns both the collection of successfully created or updated data items, as well as those that failed.  For each failure, a reason is provided.                It is important to check the failed set for any unsuccessful results.

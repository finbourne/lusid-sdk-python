# InstrumentDefinitionFormat

What is the provenance of an instrument. This defines who creates/owns it, what format it is in (e.g. a proprietary format or a common and known one)              and what the version of that is.
## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**source_system** | **str** | which source system does the format originate from | 
**vendor** | **str** | An instrument will potentially have been created by any number of different organisations. Some will be understood completely (e.g. LUSID&#39;s), some won&#39;t.              The provenance of an instrument indicates who \&quot;owns\&quot; the associated format. | 
**version** | **str** | Version of the document. Would be preferable to avoid the need, but LUSID will not control other organisations&#39; trade formats. | 
## Example

```python
from lusid.models.instrument_definition_format import InstrumentDefinitionFormat
from typing import Any, Dict
from pydantic.v1 import BaseModel, Field, constr

source_system: StrictStr = "example_source_system"
vendor: StrictStr = "example_vendor"
version: StrictStr = "example_version"
instrument_definition_format_instance = InstrumentDefinitionFormat(source_system=source_system, vendor=vendor, version=version)

```

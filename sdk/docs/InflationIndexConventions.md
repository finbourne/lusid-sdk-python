**observation_lag** | **str** | Observation lag. This is a string that must have units of Month.  This field is typically 3 or 4 months, but can vary, older bonds and swaps have 8 months lag.  For Bonds with a calculation type of Ratio, this property, if set, must be 0Invalid.

**inflation_interpolation** | **str** | Inflation Interpolation. This is optional and defaults to Linear if not set.    Supported string (enumeration) values are: [Linear, Flat]. | [optional] 
**inflation_frequency** | **str** | Frequency of inflation updated. Optional and defaults to Monthly which is the most common.

## Example

```python
from lusid.models.inflation_index_conventions import InflationIndexConventions

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of InflationIndexConventions from a JSON string
inflation_index_conventions_instance = InflationIndexConventions.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print InflationIndexConventions.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
inflation_index_conventions_dict = inflation_index_conventions_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of InflationIndexConventions from a dict
inflation_index_conventions_form_dict = inflation_index_conventions.from_dict(inflation_index_conventions_dict)

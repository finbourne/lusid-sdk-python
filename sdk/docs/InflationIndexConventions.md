# InflationIndexConventions

A set of conventions that describe the conventions for an inflation index.
## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**inflation_index_name** | **str** | Name of the index, e.g. UKRPI. | 
**currency** | **str** | Currency of the inflation index convention. | 
**observation_lag** | **str** | Observation lag. This is a string that must have units of Month. This field is typically 3 or 4 months, but can vary, older bonds and swaps have 8 months lag. For Bonds with a calculation type of Ratio, this property, if set, must be 0Invalid.  For more information on tenors, see [knowledge base article KA-02097](https://support.lusid.com/knowledgebase/article/KA-02097) | 
**inflation_interpolation** | **str** | Inflation Interpolation. This is optional and defaults to Linear if not set.  Supported string (enumeration) values are: [Linear, Flat]. | [optional] 
**inflation_frequency** | **str** | Frequency of inflation updated. Optional and defaults to Monthly which is the most common. However both Australian and New Zealand inflation is published Quarterly. Only tenors of 1M or 3M are supported.  For more information on tenors, see [knowledge base article KA-02097](https://support.lusid.com/knowledgebase/article/KA-02097) | [optional] 
**inflation_roll_day** | **int** | Day of the month that inflation rolls from one month to the next. This is optional and defaults to 1, which is the typically value for the majority of inflation bonds (exceptions include Japan which rolls on the 10th and some LatAm bonds which roll on the 15th). | [optional] 
## Example

```python
from lusid.models.inflation_index_conventions import InflationIndexConventions
from typing import Any, Dict, Optional
from pydantic.v1 import BaseModel, Field, StrictInt, StrictStr, constr

inflation_index_name: StrictStr = "example_inflation_index_name"
currency: StrictStr = "example_currency"
observation_lag: StrictStr = "example_observation_lag"
inflation_interpolation: Optional[StrictStr] = "example_inflation_interpolation"
inflation_frequency: Optional[StrictStr] = "example_inflation_frequency"
inflation_roll_day: Optional[StrictInt] = # Replace with your value
inflation_roll_day: Optional[StrictInt] = None
inflation_index_conventions_instance = InflationIndexConventions(inflation_index_name=inflation_index_name, currency=currency, observation_lag=observation_lag, inflation_interpolation=inflation_interpolation, inflation_frequency=inflation_frequency, inflation_roll_day=inflation_roll_day)

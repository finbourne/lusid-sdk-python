# DiscountingDependency

For indicating a dependency on discounting for a given currency.  E.g Valuing a Bond with the Discounting model will declare a DiscountingDependency  for the domestic currency of the bond to account for the time-value of the future cashFlows of the bond.

**currency** | **str** | The currency that needs to be discounted. | 
**var_date** | **datetime** | The effectiveDate of the entity that this is a dependency for.  Unless there is an obvious date this should be, like for a historic reset, then this is the valuation date. | 
**dependency_type** | **str** | The available values are: OpaqueDependency, CashDependency, DiscountingDependency, EquityCurveDependency, EquityVolDependency, FxDependency, FxForwardsDependency, FxVolDependency, IndexProjectionDependency, IrVolDependency, QuoteDependency, Vendor, CalendarDependency, InflationFixingDependency | 

## Example

```python
from lusid.models.discounting_dependency import DiscountingDependency

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of DiscountingDependency from a JSON string
discounting_dependency_instance = DiscountingDependency.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print DiscountingDependency.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
discounting_dependency_dict = discounting_dependency_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of DiscountingDependency from a dict
discounting_dependency_form_dict = discounting_dependency.from_dict(discounting_dependency_dict)

**currency** | **str** | The currency that needs to be discounted. | 
**var_date** | **datetime** | The effectiveDate of the entity that this is a dependency for.  Unless there is an obvious date this should be, like for a historic reset, then this is the valuation date. | 
**dependency_type** | **str** | The available values are: OpaqueDependency, CashDependency, DiscountingDependency, EquityCurveDependency, EquityVolDependency, FxDependency, FxForwardsDependency, FxVolDependency, IndexProjectionDependency, IrVolDependency, QuoteDependency, Vendor, CalendarDependency, InflationFixingDependency |

```python
from lusid.models.discounting_dependency import DiscountingDependency
from typing import List, Dict, Optional, Any, Union, TYPE_CHECKING
from typing_extensions import Annotated
from pydantic.v1 import BaseModel, StrictStr, StrictInt, StrictBool, StrictFloat, StrictBytes, Field, validator, ValidationError, conlist, constr
from datetime import datetime

currency: StrictStr = "example_currency"
var_date: datetime = # Replace with your value
dependency_type: StrictStr = "example_dependency_type"
discounting_dependency_instance = DiscountingDependency(currency=currency, var_date=var_date, dependency_type=dependency_type)

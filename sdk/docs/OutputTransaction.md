## Example

```python
from lusid.models.output_transaction import OutputTransaction

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of OutputTransaction from a JSON string
output_transaction_instance = OutputTransaction.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print OutputTransaction.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
output_transaction_dict = output_transaction_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of OutputTransaction from a dict
output_transaction_form_dict = output_transaction.from_dict(output_transaction_dict)
```

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**start_date** | **datetime** | The start date of the instrument. This is normally synonymous with the trade-date. | 
**maturity_date** | **datetime** | The final maturity date of the instrument. This means the last date on which the instruments makes a payment of any amount.  For the avoidance of doubt, that is not necessarily prior to its last sensitivity date for the purposes of risk; e.g. instruments such as  Constant Maturity Swaps (CMS) often have sensitivities to rates that may well be observed or set prior to the maturity date, but refer to a termination date beyond it. | 
**flow_conventions** | [**CdsFlowConventions**](CdsFlowConventions.md) |  | [optional] 
**coupon_rate** | **float** | The coupon rate paid on each payment date of the premium leg as a fraction of 100 percent, e.g. \&quot;0.05\&quot; meaning 500 basis points or 5%.  For a standard corporate CDS (North American) this must be either 100bps or 500bps. | 
**identifiers** | **Dict[str, str]** | External market codes and identifiers for the cds index, e.g. a RED code, BBG ID or ICE code. | 
**basket** | [**Basket**](Basket.md) |  | [optional] 
**convention_name** | [**FlowConventionName**](FlowConventionName.md) |  | [optional] 
**notional** | **float** | The notional quantity that applies to both the premium and protection legs. | 
**instrument_type** | **str** | The available values are: QuotedSecurity, InterestRateSwap, FxForward, Future, ExoticInstrument, FxOption, CreditDefaultSwap, InterestRateSwaption, Bond, EquityOption, FixedLeg, FloatingLeg, BespokeCashFlowsLeg, Unknown, TermDeposit, ContractForDifference, EquitySwap, CashPerpetual, CapFloor, CashSettled, CdsIndex, Basket, FundingLeg, FxSwap, ForwardRateAgreement, SimpleInstrument, Repo, Equity, ExchangeTradedOption, ReferenceInstrument, ComplexBond, InflationLinkedBond, InflationSwap, SimpleCashFlowLoan, TotalReturnSwap, InflationLeg, FundShareClass, FlexibleLoan, UnsettledCash, Cash | 

## Example

```python
from lusid.models.cds_index import CdsIndex

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of CdsIndex from a JSON string
cds_index_instance = CdsIndex.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print CdsIndex.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
cds_index_dict = cds_index_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of CdsIndex from a dict
cds_index_form_dict = cds_index.from_dict(cds_index_dict)

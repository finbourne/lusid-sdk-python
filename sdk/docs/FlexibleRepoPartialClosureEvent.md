# FlexibleRepoPartialClosureEvent

Event representing the partial closure of a repurchase   agreement. Each event reduces the outstanding notional   and generates a corresponding receive-leg cashflow. The   final maturity cashflow is adjusted accordingly.  If multiple events are created, their effects compound.   Once the total repaid amount reaches the original purchase   price, no further receive-leg cashflows are generated. Any   event exceeding the remaining notional is marked with a   diagnostic to indicate it is invalid due to excessive repayment.  For example, for a repo with a 5% rate, 1% haircut and   collateral value of 100 (purchase price = 99), a partial   closure of cash amount 10 followed by one of 100 results in   only the first event producing a cashflow. The second,   exceeding the remaining balance, is ignored and flagged   with a diagnostic. The remaining balance is settled at   maturity of the repurchase agreement.  Specific to a FlexibleRepo instrument.

# ExchangeTradedOptionContractDetails

Most, if not all, information about contracts is standardised. See, e.g. https://www.cmegroup.com/ for  common codes and similar data. This appears to be in common use by well known market information providers, e.g. Bloomberg and Refinitiv.  There is a lot of overlap with this and FuturesContractDetails but as that is an established DTO we must duplicate a number of fields here

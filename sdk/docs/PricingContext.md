# PricingContext

Pricing context node. In order to price an instrument a number of configuration parameters are required to determine which  (a) pricing model (ranging from a simple lookup of a market quote/price through to a Monte-Carlo simulation for the behaviour of its cashflows)  (b) vendor library (Lusid internal models or those provided through an external Vendor such as Refinitiv (proprietary) or QuantLib (open source)  are used in the pricing.    In conjunction with these there are a number of parameters that govern the behaviour of these models. For example, in pricing an Fx volatility  dependent product such as an Fx option, there are various parameters that affect model behaviour for the smile. In Lusid a distinction is made between  those which are understood natively and those which are only held for use with a given vendor-model combination. The problem is that, unlike market  quote data, there are few standards around model descriptions. Hence, apparently similar terminology can be mis-leading; for example in SABR models where  the basic parameters are agreed upon but most practical models have used an approximation with adjustments where the parameters can have wildly different meanings.  To avoid confusion or mis-behaviour in this area, where parameters are not understood to be interchangeable, they are only settable on a per-library per-model  basis, essentially as opaque data that will be given to the Vendor library \"verbatim\" but not used with any other.

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**model_rules** | [**List[VendorModelRule]**](VendorModelRule.md) | The set of model rules that are available. There may be multiple rules for Vendors, but only one per model-instrument pair.  Which of these preference sets is used depends upon the model choice selection if specified, or failing that the global default model specification  in the options. | [optional] 
**model_choice** | [**Dict[str, ModelSelection]**](ModelSelection.md) | The choice of which model selection (vendor library, pricing model) to use in evaluation of a given instrument type. | [optional] 
**options** | [**PricingOptions**](PricingOptions.md) |  | [optional] 
**result_data_rules** | [**List[ResultKeyRule]**](ResultKeyRule.md) | Set of rules that control querying of unit results either for direct queries into aggregation or for  overriding intermediate calculations. For example, a dirty price is made up from a clean price and the accrued interest.  One might consider overriding the accrued interest calculated by a model (perhaps one wants to match an external value or simply disagrees with the  calculated result) and use that in calculation of the dirty price. | [optional] 

## Example

```python
from lusid.models.pricing_context import PricingContext

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of PricingContext from a JSON string
pricing_context_instance = PricingContext.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print PricingContext.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
pricing_context_dict = pricing_context_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of PricingContext from a dict
pricing_context_form_dict = pricing_context.from_dict(pricing_context_dict)
```

```python
from lusid.models.future import Future

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of Future from a JSON string
future_instance = Future.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print Future.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
future_dict = future_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of Future from a dict
future_form_dict = future.from_dict(future_dict)

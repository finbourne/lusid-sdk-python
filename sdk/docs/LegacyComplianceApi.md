# **delete_legacy_compliance_rule**
> DeletedEntityResponse delete_legacy_compliance_rule(scope, code)

[EXPERIMENTAL] DeleteLegacyComplianceRule: Deletes a compliance rule.

Deletes the rule for all effective time.                The rule will remain viewable at previous as at times, and as part of the results of compliance runs, but it  will no longer be considered in new compliance runs.                This cannot be undone.

> ComplianceRuleUpsertResponse upsert_legacy_compliance_rules(request_body, effective_at=effective_at)

[EXPERIMENTAL] UpsertLegacyComplianceRules: Upsert compliance rules.

To upsert a new rule, the code field must be left empty, a code will then be assigned and returned as part  of the response. To update an existing rule, include the rule code. It is possible to both create and update  compliance rules in the same request.                The upsert is transactional - either all create/update operations will succeed or none of them will.

### Example

```python
import asyncio
from lusid.exceptions import ApiException
from lusid.models import *
from pprint import pprint
from lusid import (
    ApiClientFactory,
    LegacyComplianceApi
)

async def main():

    with open("secrets.json", "w") as file:
        file.write('''
{
    "api":
    {
        "tokenUrl":"<your-token-url>",
        "lusidUrl":"https://<your-domain>.lusid.com/api",
        "username":"<your-username>",
        "password":"<your-password>",
        "clientId":"<your-client-id>",
        "clientSecret":"<your-client-secret>"
    }
}''')

    # Use the lusid ApiClientFactory to build Api instances with a configured api client
    # By default this will read config from environment variables
    # Then from a secrets.json file found in the current working directory

    # Enter a context with an instance of the ApiClientFactory to ensure the connection pool is closed after use

        api_instance = api_client_factory.build(LegacyComplianceApi)
        request_body = {"Create":{"scope":"CompanyPolicies","displayName":"Max 200 Securities","type":"RangeNumberSecurities","lowerBound":0,"upperBound":200,"schedule":"PreAndPostTrade","hardRequirement":true,"targetPortfolioIds":[{"scope":"CorePortfolios","code":"UK"},{"scope":"CorePortfolios","code":"World"}],"description":"Portfolio must contain no more than 200 securities.","addressKey":"Valuation/PvInPortfolioCcy"},"Update":{"scope":"FundObjectives","code":"ComplianceRule_1","displayName":"30 percent bonds","type":"RangePercentSecurityType","value":"Bond","lowerBound":25,"upperBound":35,"schedule":"PostTrade","hardRequirement":false,"targetPortfolioIds":[{"scope":"CorePortfolios","code":"Balanced"}],"description":"Portfolio must contain 30% bonds by value.","addressKey":"Valuation/ExposureInPortfolioCcy"}} # Dict[str, ComplianceRuleUpsertRequest] | A dictionary of upsert request identifiers to rule upsert requests. The request               identifiers are valid for the request only and can be used to link the upserted compliance rule to the code               of a created compliance rule.
        effective_at = 'effective_at_example' # str | The effective datetime or cut label at which the rule will take effect. Defaults to the current LUSID  system datetime if not specified. In the case of an update, the changes will take place from this effective  time until the next effective time that the rule as been upserted at. For example, consider a rule that  already exists, and has previously had an update applied so that the definition will change on the first day  of the coming month. An upsert effective from the current day will only change the definition until the  first day of the coming month. An additional upsert at the same time (first day of the month) is required  if the newly-updated definition is to supersede the future definition. (optional)

        try:
            # [EXPERIMENTAL] UpsertLegacyComplianceRules: Upsert compliance rules.
            api_response = await api_instance.upsert_legacy_compliance_rules(request_body, effective_at=effective_at)
            pprint(api_response)

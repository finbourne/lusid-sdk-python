# LoanFacility

Loan Facility. This is a very lightweight instrument which acts as a placeholder for the events occurring within  the related facility Portfolio. This Portfolio is identified by its Scope and Code, which is recorded on the  instrument definition. The instrument acts as an agreement between a single borrower and many lenders (investors).  Several contracts may be drawn up to enable the lending of funds to the borrower. These contracts are modelled via  FlexibleLoan instruments in LUSID. The events occurring within the linked Portfolio may be related  to the facility as a whole (for example to define a global commitment amount), or they may relate to a single  contract (such as a paydown transaction on a particular contract).

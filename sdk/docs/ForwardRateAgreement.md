# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of ForwardRateAgreement from a JSON string
forward_rate_agreement_instance = ForwardRateAgreement.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print ForwardRateAgreement.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
forward_rate_agreement_dict = forward_rate_agreement_instance.to_dict()

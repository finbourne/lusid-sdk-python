## Example

```python
from lusid.models.equity_vol_dependency import EquityVolDependency

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of EquityVolDependency from a JSON string
equity_vol_dependency_instance = EquityVolDependency.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print EquityVolDependency.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
equity_vol_dependency_dict = equity_vol_dependency_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of EquityVolDependency from a dict
equity_vol_dependency_form_dict = equity_vol_dependency.from_dict(equity_vol_dependency_dict)

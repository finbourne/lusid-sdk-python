## Example

```python
from lusid.models.instrument_cash_flow import InstrumentCashFlow

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of InstrumentCashFlow from a JSON string
instrument_cash_flow_instance = InstrumentCashFlow.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print InstrumentCashFlow.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
instrument_cash_flow_dict = instrument_cash_flow_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of InstrumentCashFlow from a dict
instrument_cash_flow_form_dict = instrument_cash_flow.from_dict(instrument_cash_flow_dict)

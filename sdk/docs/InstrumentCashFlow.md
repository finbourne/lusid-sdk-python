The details for the cashflow associated with an instrument from a given portfolio.
## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**payment_date** | **datetime** | The date at which the given cash flow is due to be paid (SettlementDate is used somewhat interchangeably with PaymentDate.) | 
**amount** | **float** | The quantity (amount) that will be paid. Note that this can be empty if the payment is in the future and a model is used that cannot estimate it. | [optional] 
**currency** | **str** | The payment currency of the cash flow. | 
**source_portfolio_id** | [**ResourceId**](ResourceId.md) |  | 
**source_transaction_id** | **str** | The identifier for the parent transaction on the instrument that will pay/receive this cash flow. | 
**source_instrument_scope** | **str** | The unique Lusid Instrument Id (LUID) of the instrument that the holding is in. | 
**source_instrument_id** | **str** | The unique Lusid Instrument Id (LUID) of the instrument that the holding is in. | 
**diagnostics** | **Dict[str, str]** | Whilst a cash flow is defined by an (amount,ccy) pair and the date it is paid on there is additional information required for diagnostics. This includes a range of information and can be empty in the case of a simple cash quantity or where further information is not available. Typical information includes items such as reset dates, RIC, accrual start/end, number of days and curve data. | 
**links** | [**List[Link]**](Link.md) |  | [optional]

from typing import Any, Dict, List, Optional, Union
from pydantic.v1 import BaseModel, Field, StrictFloat, StrictInt, StrictStr, conlist, constr
from datetime import datetime

diagnostics: Dict[str, StrictStr] = # Replace with your value
links: Optional[conlist(Link)] = None
instrument_cash_flow_instance = InstrumentCashFlow(payment_date=payment_date, amount=amount, currency=currency, source_portfolio_id=source_portfolio_id, source_transaction_id=source_transaction_id, source_instrument_scope=source_instrument_scope, source_instrument_id=source_instrument_id, diagnostics=diagnostics, links=links)

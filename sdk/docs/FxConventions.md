# FxConventions

The conventions for the calculation of FX fixings, where the fixing rate is expected to be the amount of  DomCcy per unit of FgnCcy.  As an example, assume the required fixing is the WM/R 4pm mid closing rate for the USD amount per 1 EUR.  This is published with RIC EURUSDFIXM=WM, which would be the FixingReference, with FgnCcy EUR and DomCcy USD.

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**fgn_ccy** | **str** | The foreign currency | 
**dom_ccy** | **str** | The domestic currency | 
**fixing_reference** | **str** | The reference name used to find the desired quote | 

## Example

```python
from lusid.models.fx_conventions import FxConventions

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of FxConventions from a JSON string
fx_conventions_instance = FxConventions.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print FxConventions.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
fx_conventions_dict = fx_conventions_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of FxConventions from a dict
fx_conventions_form_dict = fx_conventions.from_dict(fx_conventions_dict)

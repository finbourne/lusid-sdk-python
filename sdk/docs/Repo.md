# create an instance of Repo from a JSON string
repo_instance = Repo.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print Repo.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
repo_dict = repo_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of Repo from a dict
repo_form_dict = repo.from_dict(repo_dict)

**maturity_date** | **datetime** | The final maturity date of the instrument. This means the last date on which the instruments makes a payment of any amount.  For the avoidance of doubt, that is not necessarily prior to its last sensitivity date for the purposes of risk; e.g. instruments such as  Constant Maturity Swaps (CMS) often have sensitivities to rates that may well be observed or set prior to the maturity date, but refer to a termination date beyond it. | 
**dom_amount** | **float** | The amount that is to be paid in the domestic currency on the maturity date. | 
**dom_ccy** | **str** | The domestic currency of the instrument. | 
**fgn_amount** | **float** | The amount that is to be paid in the foreign currency on the maturity date. | 
**fgn_ccy** | **str** | The foreign (other) currency of the instrument. In the NDF case, only payments are made in the domestic currency.  For the outright forward, currencies are exchanged. | 
**ref_spot_rate** | **float** | The reference Fx Spot rate for currency pair Foreign-Domestic that was seen on the trade start date (time). | [optional] 
**is_ndf** | **bool** | Is the contract an Fx-Forward of \&quot;Non-Deliverable\&quot; type, meaning a single payment in the domestic currency based on the change in fx-rate vs  a reference rate is used. | [optional]

```python
from lusid.models.fx_forward import FxForward

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of FxForward from a JSON string
fx_forward_instance = FxForward.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print FxForward.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
fx_forward_dict = fx_forward_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of FxForward from a dict
fx_forward_form_dict = fx_forward.from_dict(fx_forward_dict)

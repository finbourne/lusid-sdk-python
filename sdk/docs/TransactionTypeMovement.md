# TransactionTypeMovement


## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**movement_types** | **str** | Movement types determine the impact of the movement on the holdings. The available values are: Settlement, Traded, StockMovement, FutureCash,  Commitment, Receivable, CashSettlement, CashForward, CashCommitment, CashReceivable, Accrual, CashAccrual, ForwardFx, CashFxForward, UnsettledCashTypes, Carry, CarryAsPnl, VariationMargin, Capital, Fee. | 
**side** | **str** | The Side determines which of the fields from our transaction are used to generate the Movement. Side1 means the &#39;security&#39; side of the transaction, ie the Instrument and Units; Side2 means the &#39;cash&#39; side, ie the Total Consideration | 
**direction** | **int** |  A multiplier to apply to Transaction amounts; the values are -1 to indicate to reverse the signs and 1 to indicate to use the signed values from the Transaction directly. For a typical Transaction with unsigned values, 1 means increase, -1 means decrease | 
**properties** | [**Dict[str, PerpetualProperty]**](PerpetualProperty.md) | The properties associated with the underlying Movement | [optional] 
**mappings** | [**List[TransactionTypePropertyMapping]**](TransactionTypePropertyMapping.md) | This allows you to map a transaction property to a property on the underlying holding | [optional] 
**name** | **str** | The movement name (optional) | [optional] 
**movement_options** | **List[str]** | Allows extra specifications for the movement. The options currently available are &#39;DirectAdjustment&#39;, &#39;IncludesTradedInterest&#39; and &#39;Virtual&#39; (works only with the movement type &#39;StockMovement&#39;). A movement type of &#39;StockMovement&#39; with an option of &#39;DirectAdjusment&#39; will allow you to adjust the units of a holding without affecting its cost base. You will, therefore, be able to reflect the impact of a stock split by loading a Transaction. | [optional] 
**settlement_date_override** | **str** | Optional property key that must be in the Transaction domain when specified. When the movement is processed and the transaction has this property set to a valid date, then the property value will override the SettlementDate of the transaction. | [optional] 
**condition** | **str** | The condition that the transaction must satisfy to generate the movement, such as: Portfolio.BaseCurrency eq &#39;GBP&#39;. The condition can contain fields and properties from transactions and portfolios. If no condition is provided, the movement will apply for all transactions of this type. | [optional] 

## Example

```python
from lusid.models.transaction_type_movement import TransactionTypeMovement

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of TransactionTypeMovement from a JSON string
transaction_type_movement_instance = TransactionTypeMovement.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print TransactionTypeMovement.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
transaction_type_movement_dict = transaction_type_movement_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of TransactionTypeMovement from a dict
transaction_type_movement_form_dict = transaction_type_movement.from_dict(transaction_type_movement_dict)

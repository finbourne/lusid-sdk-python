# FundingLegAllOf


## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**start_date** | **datetime** | The start date of the instrument. This is normally synonymous with the trade-date. | 
**maturity_date** | **datetime** | The final maturity date of the instrument. This means the last date on which the instruments makes a payment of any amount.  For the avoidance of doubt, that is not necessarily prior to its last sensitivity date for the purposes of risk; e.g. instruments such as  Constant Maturity Swaps (CMS) often have sensitivities to rates beyond their last payment date. | 
**leg_definition** | [**LegDefinition**](LegDefinition.md) |  | 
**notional** | **float** | The initial notional of the Funding Leg instrument.  When \&quot;RequiresFundingLegHistory\&quot; property key is present in transaction key, during a GetValuation endpoint call (for instance),  this field would overriden by the Funding Leg history&#39;s notional and this notional field would not be used in the pricing and accrual calculations.  As such, we recommend setting this to 0 or not setting it at all.

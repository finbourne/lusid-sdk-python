# VendorModelRule

A rule that identifies the set of preferences to be used for a given library, model and instrument type. There can be many such rules, though only the first found for a given combination would be used.
## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**supplier** | **str** | The available values are: Lusid, RefinitivQps, RefinitivTracsWeb, VolMaster, IsdaCds, YieldBook, LusidCalc | 
**model_name** | **str** | The vendor library model name | 
**instrument_type** | **str** | The vendor library instrument type | 
**parameters** | **str** | THIS FIELD IS DEPRECATED - use ModelOptions The set of opaque model parameters, provided as a Json object, that is a string object which will internally be converted to a dictionary of string to object. Note that this is not intended as the final form of this object. It will be replaced with a more structured object as the set of parameters that are possible is better understood. | [optional] 
**model_options** | [**ModelOptions**](ModelOptions.md) |  | [optional] 
**instrument_id** | **str** | This field should generally not be required. It indicates a specific case where there is a particular need to make a rule apply to only a single instrument specified by an identifier on that instrument such as its LUID. One particular example would be to control the behaviour of a look-through portfolio scaling methodology, such as where there is a mixture of indices and credit-debit portfolios where scaling on the sum of valuation would be deemed incorrectly for one set but desired in general. | [optional] 
**address_key_filters** | [**List[AddressKeyFilter]**](AddressKeyFilter.md) | Condition for model selection. If a condition is satisfied the default model for valuation is overridden (for that instrument). | [optional] 
## Example

```python
from lusid.models.vendor_model_rule import VendorModelRule
from typing import Any, Dict, List, Optional
from pydantic.v1 import BaseModel, Field, StrictStr, conlist, constr, validator

supplier: StrictStr = "example_supplier"
model_name: StrictStr = "example_model_name"
instrument_type: StrictStr = "example_instrument_type"
parameters: Optional[StrictStr] = "example_parameters"
model_options: Optional[ModelOptions] = # Replace with your value
instrument_id: Optional[StrictStr] = "example_instrument_id"
address_key_filters: Optional[conlist(AddressKeyFilter)] = # Replace with your value
vendor_model_rule_instance = VendorModelRule(supplier=supplier, model_name=model_name, instrument_type=instrument_type, parameters=parameters, model_options=model_options, instrument_id=instrument_id, address_key_filters=address_key_filters)

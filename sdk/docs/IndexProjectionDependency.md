# IndexProjectionDependency

Represents either a dependency on projections of an index.  E.g. If the interest leg of a swap is a FloatingLeg, then it will declare an IndexProjectionDependency upon pricing.  This is to indicate that pricing the floating leg requires predictions of future fixings of the index.
## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**currency** | **str** | The currency of the corresponding IndexConvention. E.g. this would be USD for a convention named USD.6M.LIBOR | 
**tenor** | **str** | The tenor of the corresponding IndexConvention. E.g. this would be \&quot;6M\&quot; for a convention named USD.6M.LIBOR | 
**index_name** | **str** | The IndexName of the corresponding IndexConvention. E.g. this would be \&quot;LIBOR\&quot; for a convention named USD.6M.LIBOR | 
**var_date** | **datetime** | The effectiveDate of the entity that this is a dependency for.  Unless there is an obvious date this should be, like for a historic reset, then this is the valuation date. | 
**dependency_type** | **str** | The available values are: OpaqueDependency, CashDependency, DiscountingDependency, EquityCurveDependency, EquityVolDependency, FxDependency, FxForwardsDependency, FxVolDependency, IndexProjectionDependency, IrVolDependency, QuoteDependency, Vendor, CalendarDependency, InflationFixingDependency | 
## Example

```python
from lusid.models.index_projection_dependency import IndexProjectionDependency
from typing import List, Dict, Optional, Any, Union, TYPE_CHECKING
from typing_extensions import Annotated
from pydantic.v1 import BaseModel, StrictStr, StrictInt, StrictBool, StrictFloat, StrictBytes, Field, validator, ValidationError, conlist, constr
from datetime import datetime

currency: StrictStr = "example_currency"
tenor: StrictStr = "example_tenor"
index_name: StrictStr = "example_index_name"
var_date: datetime = # Replace with your value
dependency_type: StrictStr = "example_dependency_type"
index_projection_dependency_instance = IndexProjectionDependency(currency=currency, tenor=tenor, index_name=index_name, var_date=var_date, dependency_type=dependency_type)

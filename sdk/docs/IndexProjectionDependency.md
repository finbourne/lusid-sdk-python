# IndexProjectionDependency

Represents either a dependency on projections of an index.  E.g. If the interest leg of a swap is a FloatingLeg, then it will declare an IndexProjectionDependency upon pricing.  This is to indicate that pricing the floating leg requires predictions of future fixings of the index.

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**currency** | **str** | The currency of the corresponding IndexConvention. E.g. this would be USD for a convention named USD.6M.LIBOR | 
**tenor** | **str** | The tenor of the corresponding IndexConvention. E.g. this would be \&quot;6M\&quot; for a convention named USD.6M.LIBOR | 
**index_name** | **str** | The IndexName of the corresponding IndexConvention. E.g. this would be \&quot;LIBOR\&quot; for a convention named USD.6M.LIBOR | 
**var_date** | **datetime** | The effectiveDate of the entity that this is a dependency for.  Unless there is an obvious date this should be, like for a historic reset, then this is the valuation date. | 
**dependency_type** | **str** | The available values are: OpaqueDependency, CashDependency, DiscountingDependency, EquityCurveDependency, EquityVolDependency, FxDependency, FxForwardsDependency, FxVolDependency, IndexProjectionDependency, IrVolDependency, QuoteDependency, Vendor, CalendarDependency, InflationFixingDependency | 

## Example

```python
from lusid.models.index_projection_dependency import IndexProjectionDependency

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of IndexProjectionDependency from a JSON string
index_projection_dependency_instance = IndexProjectionDependency.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print IndexProjectionDependency.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
index_projection_dependency_dict = index_projection_dependency_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of IndexProjectionDependency from a dict
index_projection_dependency_form_dict = index_projection_dependency.from_dict(index_projection_dependency_dict)

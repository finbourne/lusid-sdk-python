Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------

**maturity_date** | **datetime** | The final maturity date of the instrument. This means the last date on which the instruments makes a payment of any amount.

## Example

```python
from lusid.models.interest_rate_swap import InterestRateSwap

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of InterestRateSwap from a JSON string
interest_rate_swap_instance = InterestRateSwap.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print InterestRateSwap.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
interest_rate_swap_dict = interest_rate_swap_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of InterestRateSwap from a dict
interest_rate_swap_form_dict = interest_rate_swap.from_dict(interest_rate_swap_dict)

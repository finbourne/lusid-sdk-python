# InflationSwap

LUSID representation of an Inflation Swap.  The implementation supports the following swap types:  * Zero Coupon inflation swap, with a single payment at maturity.  * LPI Swap (capped and floored)  * Year on Year inflation swap                This instrument has multiple legs, to see how legs are used in LUSID see [knowledge base article KA-02252](https://support.lusid.com/knowledgebase/article/KA-02252).                | Leg Index | Leg Identifier | Description |  | --------- | -------------- | ----------- |  | 1 | InflationLeg | Cash flows with a rate relating to an underlying inflation index. |  | 2 | FixedLeg | Cash flows with a fixed rate. |  | 3 | AdditionalPayments | Cash flows relating to any additional payments (optional). |
## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**start_date** | **datetime** | The start date of the instrument. This is normally synonymous with the trade-date. | 
**maturity_date** | **datetime** | The final maturity date of the instrument. This means the last date on which the instruments makes a payment of any amount.  For the avoidance of doubt, that is not necessarily prior to its last sensitivity date for the purposes of risk; e.g. instruments such as  Constant Maturity Swaps (CMS) often have sensitivities to rates that may well be observed or set prior to the maturity date, but refer to a termination date beyond it. | 
**inflation_leg** | [**InflationLeg**](InflationLeg.md) |  | 
**fixed_leg** | [**FixedLeg**](FixedLeg.md) |  | 
**additional_payments** | [**List[AdditionalPayment]**](AdditionalPayment.md) | Optional additional payments at a given date e.g. to level off an uneven inflation swap.  The dates must be distinct and either all payments are Pay or all payments are Receive. | [optional] 
**time_zone_conventions** | [**TimeZoneConventions**](TimeZoneConventions.md) |  | [optional] 
**instrument_type** | **str** | The available values are: QuotedSecurity, InterestRateSwap, FxForward, Future, ExoticInstrument, FxOption, CreditDefaultSwap, InterestRateSwaption, Bond, EquityOption, FixedLeg, FloatingLeg, BespokeCashFlowsLeg, Unknown, TermDeposit, ContractForDifference, EquitySwap, CashPerpetual, CapFloor, CashSettled, CdsIndex, Basket, FundingLeg, FxSwap, ForwardRateAgreement, SimpleInstrument, Repo, Equity, ExchangeTradedOption, ReferenceInstrument, ComplexBond, InflationLinkedBond, InflationSwap, SimpleCashFlowLoan, TotalReturnSwap, InflationLeg, FundShareClass, FlexibleLoan, UnsettledCash, Cash, MasteredInstrument, LoanFacility, FlexibleDeposit, FlexibleRepo |

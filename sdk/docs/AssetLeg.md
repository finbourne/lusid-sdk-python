# AssetLeg

The underlying instrument representing one side of the TRS and its pay-receive direction.              Note that TRS currently only supports an asset of Bond or ComplexBond, no other instruments are allowed. Support for additional instrument types will be added in the future.
## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**asset** | [**LusidInstrument**](LusidInstrument.md) |  | 
**pay_receive** | **str** | Either Pay or Receive stating direction of the asset in the swap.  Supported string (enumeration) values are: [Pay, Receive]. | 
## Example

```python
from lusid.models.asset_leg import AssetLeg
from typing import Any, Dict
from pydantic.v1 import BaseModel, Field, constr

asset: LusidInstrument = # Replace with your value
pay_receive: StrictStr = "example_pay_receive"
asset_leg_instance = AssetLeg(asset=asset, pay_receive=pay_receive)

```

# MarketDataKeyRule

A market data key rule describes a mapping for satisfying a particular market dependency. The supplier, scope, quote type and price side  information define the quote in the market and which Vendor for market data would be used to perform the lookup.  The market data key defines what dependency this satisfies. The key is a rule that describes the asset class, its identifier and any other  specifics required to uniquely describe a specific economic entity (e.g. an Fx currency pair, equity name or credit curve).

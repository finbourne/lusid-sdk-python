# EconomicDependency

Base class for representing economic dependencies. Economic dependencies are a way of indicating how one concept depends upon another. For example, when pricing an instrument with a particular model, that model will declare that it has an EconomicDependency for each bit of market data that it needs to complete the calculation. Concretely, a pricing an FxForward will declare a dependency on the exchange rate between the two currencies at the forward date.              Another example is when data is included in a data-structure only by reference. Concretely, an object depending on a FlowConvention that is referenced only semantically via a FlowConventionName will declare a FlowConventionDependency so that the full data-structure of the referenced FlowConvention can be retrieved.              For deserialization purposes, this class contains a discriminator EconomicDependencyType to indicate the derived type.
## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**dependency_type** | **str** | The available values are: OpaqueDependency, CashDependency, DiscountingDependency, EquityCurveDependency, EquityVolDependency, FxDependency, FxForwardsDependency, FxVolDependency, IndexProjectionDependency, IrVolDependency, QuoteDependency, Vendor, CalendarDependency, InflationFixingDependency | 
## Example

```python
from lusid.models.economic_dependency import EconomicDependency
from typing import Any, Dict, Union
from pydantic.v1 import BaseModel, Field, StrictStr, validator

dependency_type: StrictStr = "example_dependency_type"
economic_dependency_instance = EconomicDependency(dependency_type=dependency_type)

```
